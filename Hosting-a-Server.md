**Hosting a Listen Server**  
To host a listen server on Northstar, go to the lobby and press the "Private Match" button to begin a private match.  
While this does allow you to host a server, other people won't be able to join it, so you'll need to port forward 2 ports to allow other people to join.  
The ports you'll need to forward are 37015-37020 UDP, and 8081 TCP by default, if this works as it should, this should result in your server being displayed on the server browser, and other clients being able to connect to it.
