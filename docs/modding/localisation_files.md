# Localisation

Northstar adds new strings to the game which can be localised to match the language you are using on your Titanfall 2 installation.

## Files to translate

There are the two files that need to be translated, use the English version as a base. After you finish make sure that the files are encoded in `UTF-16 LE` before opening a Pull Request.
