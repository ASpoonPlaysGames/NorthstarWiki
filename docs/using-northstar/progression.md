# Progression

As of version `1.19.0` Northstar allows you to toggle the progression system.
This means that you can choose whether to have everything unlocked or not.

## Enabling/Disabling Progression

1. Go into the multiplayer lobby
2. Click on the "Toggle Progression" button at the bottom of the screen
