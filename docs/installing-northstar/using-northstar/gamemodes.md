## Amped Killrace

Get kills to increase the length of your killrace. Collect the flag to start it. Set the record to win.

## Fastball

{% hint style="info" %}
Before `v1.5.0`, some maps did not have control panels yet. These maps include _Homestead_, _Complex_, _Glitch_, _Relic_, _Rise_, and _Crash Site_. Make sure to update to [`v1.5.0` or later](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) to have Fastball control panels on all maps.
