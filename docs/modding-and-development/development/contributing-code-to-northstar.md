## Guidelines

For a pull request to be merged, it has to be reviewed first. In order to make the review process as smooth as possible and therefore ensuring quick merging of your pull request, keep the following things in mind:

- If the changes you made can be summarised in a screenshot or screenrecording, make sure to add one to quickly give a reviewer an idea what your pull request is about.
- Please use a sensible title for your pull request. We squash commits when merging and as such your pull request title will be used as the commit message. We can of course edit it before merging but using a sensible title for your PR both makes it easier to understand what it is about and saves us from having to edit the title before merging.
- Please describe the changes you made. The easier it is to understand what you changed, the higher the chances of your PR being merged (in a timely manner).
- If you made multiple independent changes, please make a new PR for each one. This prevents cases where your PR is being blocked from merging by a bug one of the changes you made.
