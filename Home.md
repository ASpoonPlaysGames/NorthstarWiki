Welcome to the Northstar wiki!
Thanks to taskinoz for alot of this, I've paraphrased alot of his [guide](https://gist.github.com/taskinoz/d68fdbc1ec0590d8fe61a85edbb9c44e) for this  
  
Please remember: you should expect to encounter bugs and crashes with Northstar, i've been developing it for a while but i'm one guy and I wouldn't say i'm the best developer around.  
If you do encounter issues that this guide doesn't have a fix for, you can get support in the [discord](https://northstar.tf/discord).
