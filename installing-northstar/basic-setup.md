# Basic Setup

## Installing Northstar

> **TODO:** Adding a video showing the process would probably be best.

Firstly note that Northstar client is only available on PC and requires you to **both own the game and have it installed**.

1. Download the latest version of Northstar from the [releases](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) page
2. Copy all the files in the newly downloaded zip folder to your Titanfall folder

> TODO: Method to get to Origin's local files here is incorrect/doesn't exist
* **For Steam** - Right click _Titanfall 2_ > Open _Properties_ > Click _Local Files_ > Click _Browse_
* **For Origin** - Click Titanfall 2 in the Library > Click the gear icon > Click _Game Properties_

1. Launch NorthstarLauncher.exe to start Northstar\
   After launching, you should be greeted with something like this:\

Should you notice any issues/warnings/errors while running Northstar, check the troubleshooting page.

## Additional Stuff

Since Northstar doesn't launch directly through Origin, any startup arguments provided in origin won't transfer over, you'll need to add them to the file `ns_startup_args.txt`, which should be in the same folder as you extracted the Northstar files to.

If Northstar doesn't appear to be installed, or you have issues entering the lobby, try running vanilla files, I can't personally say what VPK mods could cause issues with Northstar at the moment, so it'd probably be easiest just to try running unmodded.
